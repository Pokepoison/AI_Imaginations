  ## Description:
  Hello and welcome to AI Imaginations. The purpose of this application is to allow users to create and save AI generated images. Not only can users create their own files but they can also share with other users. When the application is first loaded the page opens with a community showcase along with the users to search for post or create their own Ai generated image. When the user clicks on the create button a new page opens that allows users to enter their name, prompt an image they want the Ai to generate or even generate a surprise image from the Ai itself, a generate button to allow the Ai to generate the photo and a share with the community button so that other users can see Ai generated images. Once the image is generated if the user no longer wants to share or keep the image they are able to delete it from their image generator. The following technology is used in order to make this application successful: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and React.js from MERN stack. Along with Tailwind for CSS framework, OPENAI's DALL-E model as a learning model that generates the images from the text input and Cloudinary as a cloud-based image storage. We hope you enjoy and have fun using our application!
